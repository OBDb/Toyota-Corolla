generations:
  - name: "First Generation (E10)"
    start_year: 1966
    end_year: 1970
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Corolla established what would become the world's best-selling automotive nameplate, introduced as a small, economical car designed to meet the needs of Japan's growing middle class. Available in sedan, coupe, and wagon body styles, the original Corolla featured compact dimensions, a simple design, and straightforward mechanicals including a 1.1-liter engine producing just 60 horsepower, paired with either a 4-speed manual or 2-speed automatic transmission driving the rear wheels. By modern standards the first Corolla was extremely basic, with minimal amenities and a focus on affordability and reliability rather than comfort or performance. Despite its simplicity, the Corolla quickly gained popularity in Japan and began expanding to international markets, laying the groundwork for Toyota's global growth through an efficient, dependable product that delivered on its promises—a formula that would define the Corolla nameplate for decades to come."

  - name: "Second Generation (E20)"
    start_year: 1970
    end_year: 1974
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Corolla grew slightly in all dimensions while maintaining its focus on simplicity and reliability. Available in an expanded range of body styles including sedan, coupe, wagon, and hardtop, this generation featured more rounded styling than its predecessor with a slightly more upscale appearance. Engine options expanded to include 1.2-liter and 1.6-liter units with modest increases in power, while maintaining the rear-wheel drive layout. Interior space improved through the increased dimensions, though amenities remained basic by modern standards. This generation saw significantly expanded global distribution, particularly in North America where the Corolla began building its reputation for trouble-free operation and value, attributes that would become core to the nameplate's identity. The second-generation Corolla helped establish Toyota as a legitimate competitor in international markets through a product that emphasized practical transportation with minimal fuss—a straightforward approach that resonated with pragmatic consumers worldwide."
