generations:
  - name: "First Generation (E10)"
    start_year: 1966
    end_year: 1970
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Corolla established what would become the world's best-selling automotive nameplate, introduced as a small, economical car designed to meet the needs of Japan's growing middle class. Available in sedan, coupe, and wagon body styles, the original Corolla featured compact dimensions, a simple design, and straightforward mechanicals including a 1.1-liter engine producing just 60 horsepower, paired with either a 4-speed manual or 2-speed automatic transmission driving the rear wheels. By modern standards the first Corolla was extremely basic, with minimal amenities and a focus on affordability and reliability rather than comfort or performance. Despite its simplicity, the Corolla quickly gained popularity in Japan and began expanding to international markets, laying the groundwork for Toyota's global growth through an efficient, dependable product that delivered on its promises—a formula that would define the Corolla nameplate for decades to come."

    description: "The twelfth-generation Toyota Corolla represents the most significant redesign in the model's recent history, transitioning to the TNGA-C (Toyota New Global Architecture) platform shared with the Prius and C-HR, with a focus on improved driving dynamics without compromising the traditional Corolla virtues of reliability and practicality. Available in sedan, hatchback, and wagon (primarily in Europe) body styles, this generation features more cohesive global design than its predecessors, though with regional variations in features and powertrains. The exterior design is significantly more expressive with a lower, wider stance, a more aggressive front fascia, and distinctive LED lighting signatures, while maintaining recognizable Corolla proportions. Engine options vary by market but typically include a 1.8-liter gasoline engine, a more powerful 2.0-liter option in some regions, and notably, a much-expanded hybrid lineup that has become the volume seller in many markets, offering up to 50+ mpg efficiency. Interior quality reaches new heights with soft-touch materials in most areas, a standard 7 or 8-inch (later up to 10.5-inch) touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and available features including a digital instrument cluster, wireless charging, and premium audio. Safety technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 or later standard across most markets, offering advanced driver assistance features including adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, lane tracing assist, and road sign assist. Driving dynamics are significantly improved through the new platform's lower center of gravity, increased rigidity, and revised suspension tuning, creating a more engaging experience without sacrificing comfort. A refresh for the 2023 model year brought updated styling, new infotainment software, and further refined hybrid systems. The twelfth-generation Corolla successfully balances the model's traditional strengths with modern design, technology, and driving dynamics, helping maintain its position as one of the world's best-selling cars despite the continued market shift toward crossovers and SUVs."
